TDR-S is a 2-cycle health condition classification system. 
It consists of a fast answer cycle and a slow answer cycle. 
The fast answer cycle offers immediate answer using an outliner based detection model that takes into account both $F_c$ 
and $F_s$. 
On the other hand, the slow answer cycle is a social network based model that allows beginners to learn from experts, 
who are ususally minorities in the social network, in the social network. 
The slow answer cycle offers answer when a person that satisfies certain requirement offer answer. 
More details are presented in Section~\ref{sec:fastCycle} and Section~\ref{sec:slowCycle}.
