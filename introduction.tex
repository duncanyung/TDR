{\bf the use of $F_s$ and pros and cons}

{\bf the propose of TDF-S}
TDR-S is a health condition classification system that takes into account 
traditional Chinese medicine measurements $F_c$ and scientific health measurements $F_s$. 
We believe that $F_c$ and $F_s$ can complement each other in the model. 

{\bf reason for using both $F_c$ and $F_s$}

{\bf what is used to build model for $F_c$}

{\bf what is used to build model for $F_s$}

{\bf the use of social network for learning}

{\bf the purpose of using social network to learn}

{\bf how the social network model can compliment the model for $F_c$ and $F_s$}
