% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti ---> griscti@acm.org
%
% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to
% Gerald Murray ---> murray@hq.acm.org

% For tracking purposes - this is V3.1SP - APRIL 2009

% \begin{abstract}
% This paper provides a sample of a \LaTeX\ document which conforms to
% the formatting guidelines for ACM SIG Proceedings.
% It complements the document \textit{Author's Guide to Preparing
% ACM SIG Proceedings Using \LaTeX$2_\epsilon$\ and Bib\TeX}. This
% source file has been written with the intention of being
% compiled under \LaTeX$2_\epsilon$\ and BibTeX.

% The developers have tried to include every imaginable sort
% of ``bells and whistles", such as a subtitle, footnotes on
% title, subtitle and authors, as well as in the text, and
% every optional component (e.g. Acknowledgments, Additional
% Authors, Appendices), not to mention examples of
% equations, theorems, tables and figures.

% To make best use of this sample document, run it through \LaTeX\
% and BibTeX, and compare this source code with the printed
% output produced by the dvi file.\cite{duncankNN}

% {\bf \large Abstract:}
% According to statistics from Boston police department, 
% there are more than 30 thousand crime incident reported in Boston in 2012. 
% Hence, it is not rare that crimes happen in places that you often pass by and in your neighborhood.
% CrimeAlert is a real time crime prediction system that help people to predict whether a crime (e.g. robbery, burglary, assault, theft, shooting) 
% will happen in a location. The system is based on a decision tree model which exploit meteorological, spatial, and temporal features for prediction.
% We evaluated our model using cross-validation and the result shows that our model has an 97$\%$ accuracy.
